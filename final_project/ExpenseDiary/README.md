## Project Status

Walley is currently in a **stable foundation phase**.

### Completed
- Traditional expense tracking & budgeting
- Unified add-expense pipeline (manual + auto)
- Behavior-aware data model (category, one-time flags)
- Deterministic Rules Engine for financial awareness
- EVE AI architecture (explanation-only, no decision logic)

### Paused (Planned Next)
- LLM integration & prompt refinement
- Observation-based testing
- UI/UX micro-interactions & polish
- Analytics & monthly narratives

The current version is intentionally frozen to preserve architectural clarity.
